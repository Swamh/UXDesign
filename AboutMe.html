        Hello, my name is Swam and I am an aspiring manager in corporate environments. 
I am an easy-going, assertive, confident, enthusiastic, direct, spontaneous and creative team player and aspiring leader in my personal, school and work lives.
I first worked at CA-CIB in 2022 for about 8 months, where I did work on Java as well as conducting LEAN Trainings to several sections in CA-CIB as a side job and main job closer to the end of my working days in CA-CIB.
I worked at NCS in 2023 as a Software Engineer under the Fusion Program for about 1 month.
Before the above, I worked for Micro2000 as an intern, doing counter duty at Woodlands11, doing basic data entry and handling replacement parts for Singtel customers. I then did SSOE Work where I head to schools across Singapore to provision new laptops and equipment, extract hard disks and sanitize outdated IT Equipment. In between, I worked as a doorman and sometimes counter duty for +Serv Orchard near Somerset MRT.
Before that, I worked in KFC as a cashier for about a month in 2019 and learnt the basics of customer service and the working world.
